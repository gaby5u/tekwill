    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.    </p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
